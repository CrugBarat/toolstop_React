**Web App Framework**: React

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

# Brief

**Stage 1 - Top 40 landing page**:

We have set up two Top 40 endpoints on our server for you to use (see assets sheet). Use these
endpoints to fetch the Top 40 sellers on the Toolstop site, use the fetched data to build a fully
React page displaying the brand categories (asset sheet image 1). This page should be desktop
and mobile friendly.

**Stage 2 - Category page**:

Currently, the Toolstop site is only partially built using React, we are looking to refactor existing
pages into fully React components. One of the main pages we are looking to refactor is the
category page (asset sheet image 2). Build this page to be desktop friendly, donâ€™t worry about
mobile. It should display all relevant information similar to what the current category pages display.
When clicking on a product it should link through to the correct product on the existing
Toolstop.co.uk site.

**Stage 3 - Hosting your site**:

At Toolstop developers are expected to handle everything from CSS to DevOps, once you are
happy with your site, host it on whatever platform you wish.
